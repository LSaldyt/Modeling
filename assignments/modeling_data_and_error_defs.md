# Definitions for Terms from Modeling Data and Error lecture

### Terms:
 - _Residual_  
   Difference between observed value and predicted value (`y` and `ŷ`)
 - _Regression Line_  
   Line of the form `y = mx + b` that aims to make the sum of residuals equal to 0
 - _Sample Value_  
   Independent variable (`y`) that represents real data
 - _Predicted Value_  
   Point on regression line (`ŷ`)
 - _Sample Average_  
   Arithmetic mean of sample values `m=1n∑(i=1,n,xi)` (` ̄̄y`)
 - _Explained variation_  
   Proportion to which a mathematical model accounts for the variation of a given data set. `(∑(i=1,n,ŷi - ̄y) ^2`(Signal)  
 - _Unexplained variation_  
   Part of a model that allows for variation within a dataset AKA sum of squares error `(∑(i=1,n,ŷi - yi) ^2` (Noise)  
 - _Total variation_  
   Sum of explained and unexplained variances
 - _Correlation coefficient_  
   Number that quantifies statistical relationships between two or more random variables or observed data values (`r = +/- sqrt(explained/total)`)
 - _Coeffificient of determination_  
   Number that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable (`r^2 = explained/total`)
 - _Standard error of estimate_  
   Estimate of standard deviation of sampling distribution for a statistic
 - _Prediction interval_  
   Estimate of an interval where future observations will fall with a certain probability, given what has already been observed.
 - _Bivariate normal distribution_  
   Statistical distribution with the probability density function (See [Wolfram Alpha](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BivariateNormalDistribution.html))
