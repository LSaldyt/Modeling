### Lecture:

Theoretical vs Statistical probabilities

`P(E)` = probability of event

`P(E) = number of outcomes in E / Total in sample space`

#### Theoretical:

For a die
`P(x>=2) = 5/6` (Five valid rolls, one will be less than 2)

> "Theoretical is always perfectly accurate.. in theory." 

#### Statistical:

`Statistical P(E) = Frequency of E in sample / total number of samples`

`P(New Mexicans vote Gary Johnson) = 15/100` (Fifteen people of one hundred will vote Gary Johnson)

Samples = Observations

Statistical probability *estimates* the theoretical.

Accuracy increases as sample size increases (*usually*).  
This wont work if there is sample bias (ex Asking only libertarians about Gary Johnson)


#### Axioms of probability

`0 <= P(E) <= 1`

`P(E) = 0`: E wont happen

`P(E) = 1`: E will happen

`Sigma(i=1, n) Ei = 1`: The sum of all possible outcomes is one

**TLDR**: Something happens.

Ex:  
`S + I + R = 1`

#### Pie Charts

Area of each slice is probability of corresponding event

Create pie chart of SIR model when Infection is at peak.

Use min/max to control population size

`R = min(R, 1)`
`R = max(R, 0)`

Prevents model from "leaving reality" - but is less accurate

Any accuracy lost is already lost by model's assumptions and estimates
